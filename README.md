# Predictive Maintenance of Milling Machines - Case Study: Advanced Intelligent Systems

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed AI-driven predictive maintenance system for milling machines using sensor data. The project focuses on predicting machine failures to reduce downtime and cut maintenance costs through intelligent data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict equipment failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and reducing operational costs.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset**, which contains sensor readings and operational parameters from industrial milling machines, including:
- Air temperature
- Process temperature
- Rotational speed
- Torque
- Tool wear
- Machine failure indicators
- Failure type classifications
